Card Values:

Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10 points.
Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the hand more.
Gameplay:

Each player is dealt two cards, usually face up. The dealer also gets two cards, one face up and one face down.

Player take turns deciding whether to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).

Player can continue to "hit" as many times as they like, but if their hand total exceeds 21, they bust and lose the round.

Once all have completed their turn, the dealer reveals their face-down card.

The dealer must hit until their hand totals 17 or higher. Some casinos have different rules for the dealer, so it's essential to know the specific rules where you are playing.

If the dealer busts, all player win. If the dealer doesn't bust, then the player and dealer hands are compared, and whoever is closer to 21 without exceeding it wins.
